[Guba](http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1kos_guba) is a traditional Hungarian dessert (I don't care what anybody else says), and I finally made it for the kids based on mom's recipe. They L.O.V.E'd it, so I got that going for me, which is nice ;)

1. 5 [Kifli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kifli) (plain, get them in your local European store)
2. 4 Tbs poppyseed (grind it very VERY well!)
3. 6 Tbs white sugar (I usually grind this also, but not necessary)
4. 2 cups (1/2L) Milk
5. 1 tsp vanilla extract

Slice up the kiflis and complitely dry the pieces (after 2 days I just put it in the oven for about 30-45 minutes on 170F, don't burn them!)

Mix the poppyseed and the sugar together.

Boil the milk and mix in the vanilla.

Put the dry kifli pieces into a strainer and pour the hot milk over it.

Sprinkle the poppy seed on the whole thing, and enjyoy :)
