We used to have a house, but about 2 years ago we had to short-sell it. The process knocked our credit score down and lenders wouldn't look at us for about 3 years. Well, that's what the rules are on paper anyway.

Luckily, it seems like the local [VyStar Credit Union](https://www.vystarcu.org/home/home) will be able to help us out much sooner then we thought, so we can start house-hunting in our neighborhood as early as next month. Exciting times ahead ...
