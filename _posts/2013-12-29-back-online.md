Been a while, but this is how it usually goes :) Got a house this past August, a tiny bit smaller than I wanted but lately it just feels too big anyway.

Just had a nice week long vacation, didn't do much, setup a new server (VPS finally), so  I got the chance to play with some cool stuff like NodeJS and Apache 2.4, PHP 5.5 ... good times.

Watched a butt-load of [Doctor Who](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who) with the kids and started a new series called [Alphas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphas) - oh, and of course [Eureka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(U.S._TV_series) is still going on.
