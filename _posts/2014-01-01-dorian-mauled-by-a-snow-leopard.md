We were somewhere on a mountain, winter-time, patchy snow here and there. Dorian and Violet were playing something when Dorian started cryinga little bit. We'd calmed hime down.

We later went home and started undressing the kids when we realized that on Dorian's right leg the skin is missing. (palm sized patch), so we went back to the scene where he was crying and came to the conclusion that Dorian was mauled by a snow leopard. (my brother Peter was also there)
