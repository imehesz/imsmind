title: Six Day Headache
tags:

Since I was about 25, I started having these weird headaches. The skin on my skull hurts, all the way down to my ear (depending on which side of my skull hurts). It doesn't hurt all the time, but very sensitive to touch. It usually lasts for about 3-5 days.

This time however today is the sixth day. It's getting worse by night, but I think it will be gone by tomorrow. Luckily it only happens once or twice a year.
