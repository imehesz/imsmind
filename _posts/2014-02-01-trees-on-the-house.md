title: Trees on the house

Had a weird dream a couple of days ago. The house was surrounded by fallen trees (4-5) and there was one tree directly on top of the house. From inside the house I saw a little whole in the roof where I could see the tree itself. When I woke up, I was still looking for the whole.

We recently cut down some trees with Dan and there was an episode of Eureka where there were trees growing inside GD.
