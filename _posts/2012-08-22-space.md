Anyhow, yesterday I was listening to some interesting conversations about the universe and more importantly, the likelihood of existing life forms in space.

The hosts of [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blogland/2012/aug/20/rebroadcast-space/) (podcast) had different opinions, and that's what made the whole show so interesting.

The thing that really blew my mind was to realize that even if there were other creatures in the universe, the possibility of the evolution-lines to match is close to none. In other words: 

**We are alone!**
