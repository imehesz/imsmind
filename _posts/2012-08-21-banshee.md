I recently (re)discovered [Banshee](http://banshee.fm), the open-source music player for Linux. I used *Rhythmbox* for many years now, but lately it's been worse and worse, especially when it comes to handling podcasts. I'm only subscribed to about five or six shows, but it seems like Rhythmbox cannot handle it. 


**Banshee** in the other hand works great (so far), it's fast, looks good and does what it's supposed to. Plays music. While I was installing and setting up Banshee, I also found a cool website where you can subscribe to a bunch of online radio streams [dir.xiph.org](http://dir.xiph.org).
