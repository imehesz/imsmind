We spent our labor-day weekend this year at my brothers' place, down at **Palm City**. I like these short (2-3 days) get-aways, because I get to spend some time with my pet (coding) projects. 

I found and used a couple of cool **Javascript libraries**, like [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) a lightweight lib for parsing, manipulating and formatting dates, and [TaffyDB](http://www.taffydb.com/) which brings database features into your JavaScript applications.
