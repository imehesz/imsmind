Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated with dreams. I always wanted to keep a dream-journal but sooner or later I failed to continue :/ this is just another attempt ...

I had a dream that a miniature Batman was trying to kill me. He was as big as a child, but looked like the LEGO Batman you can see in Target these days. I lived in Hungary and I called one of my old friends (Feri) who happened to be Spider-man. He came very fast and scared the little Batman away.
